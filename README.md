[Example 1](https://github.com/waiphyo285/graphql-examples/tree/master/nodegraphql_master) GraphQL-Yoga: You will need to provide schema to Yoga, either by an existing executable schema, or by providing your type definitions and resolver map.

[Example 2](https://github.com/waiphyo285/graphql-examples/tree/master/typegraphql_master) Type-GraphQL: makes developing GraphQL APIs an enjoyable process, i.e. by defining the schema using only classes and a bit of decorator magic.
